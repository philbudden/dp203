# Nonrelational Database

- Nonrelational databases are one of two broad database types, the other being [relational databases][relational_database].

- Relational databases are often referred to as NoSQL as they traditionally don't use SQL (although some modern NoSQL databases do offer SQL-like languages)

- There are four traditional types of nonrelational databases:
    - [Key-value store][keyvalue]
    - [Document database][document_database]
    - [Graph database][graph_database]
    - [Column database][column_database]

[relational_database]: ./relational_database.md
[keyvalue]: ./keyvalue_store.md
[document_database]: ./document_database.md
[graph_database]: ./graph_database.md
[column_database]: ./column_database.md
