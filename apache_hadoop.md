- Open source software library framework maintained by the Apache Foundation

- Each node offers local computation and storage

- Designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer

- Hadoop constitutes:
    - [HDFS][hdfs]
    - [YARN][yarn]
    - [MapReduce][mapreduce]
    - [Common][common]

[hdfs]: ./hadoop_hdfs.md
[yarn]: ./hadoop_yarn.md
[mapreduce]: ./hadoop_mapreduce.md
