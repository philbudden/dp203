# Structured Data

- Structured data is one of two broad data types, the other being [nonstructured (or unstructred) data][nonstructured_data].

- Structured data is defined in tabular format, meaning the schema needs to be designed before any data is loaded. 

- Data in [Relational Database systems][relational_database] are structured data.

- It is generally slow to implement changes in relational systems because the structure needs to change every time a data requirment changes.

- New columns require bulk-update to all existing records.

- Structured data is well suited to complex queries, unlike [nonstructured data][nonstructured_data].

[nonstructured_data]: ./nonstructured_data
[relational_database]: ./relational_database
